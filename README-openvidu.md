# openvidu-livekit

This fork of [livekit](https://github.com/livekit/livekit) stores the analytics [events](https://github.com/livekit/protocol/blob/main/protobufs/livekit_analytics.proto) and stats of the server in a **MongoDB** database, in the data model that the OpenVidu Dashboard reads.

## Configuration

Extend the native livekit configuration ([`.yaml` file](https://docs.livekit.io/realtime/self-hosting/deployment/#Configuration)) with the `openvidu.analytics` section. The example sets every key but `retention.rollups_daily`; apart from `enabled`, `mongo_url` and `events.store_types`, the values are the defaults:

```yaml
openvidu:
  analytics:
    enabled: true
    mongo_url: mongodb://mongoadmin:mongopassword@localhost:27017/?replicaSet=rs0&readPreference=primaryPreferred

    retention:
      events: 7d
      stats: 7d
      tracks: 7d
      entities: 90d
      rollups_5min: 7d
      rollups_hourly: 400d
    stats_detail: participant

Durations are Go durations (`10s`, `168h`, `1h30m`), optionally preceded by a whole number of days (`7d`, `400d`, `1d12h`); a bare integer is read as nanoseconds. Retentions are at least `1h`, at most 2^31−1 seconds (`24855d3h14m7s`, the MongoDB TTL limit) and in whole seconds. By default every event type the server emits is kept raw except `TRACK_PUBLISHED_UPDATE`, `TRACK_MAX_SUBSCRIBED_VIDEO_QUALITY` and `TRACK_SUBSCRIBE_REQUESTED`.

Every key can also be set with an environment variable named `LIVEKIT_OPENVIDU_ANALYTICS_` plus the key path in upper case with `_` for `.`, for example `LIVEKIT_OPENVIDU_ANALYTICS_RETENTION_EVENTS=30d` or `LIVEKIT_OPENVIDU_ANALYTICS_EVENTS_STORE_TYPES=ROOM_CREATED,ROOM_ENDED`.

An invalid value stops the server at startup with an error that names the key. The effective configuration is logged at startup, with durations in the same syntax.

## What is written

At startup the server creates or updates the collections, validators and indexes of the data model, whose contract is vendored in [`openvidu/analytics/schema/contract`](./openvidu/analytics/schema/contract), and records the schema version, retention and capabilities in `schema_meta`. An `events` collection written by previous versions is renamed to `legacy_events`.

Every `interval`, each node writes one batch: rooms, participants, tracks, subscriptions, egress, ingress and ingress sessions (idempotent updates, so a replayed or reordered batch converges), raw events, statistics (`track_stats`, a time-series collection when the server supports it), 5-minute, hourly and daily rollups, and its heartbeat in `nodes`. A batch that fails with a transient error (network, election) is retried first in the next interval. On a graceful shutdown the queues are written for at most 5 s.

Credentials (TURN passwords, storage keys, stream keys, tokens in URLs) are never stored: protocol messages go through an allow-list.

## Legacy data migration

Versions before 3.10 stored analytics in the `events`, `stats`, `active_entities` and `last_alive` collections. The
first start of the new version renames `events` to `legacy_events`, records `schema_meta` `_id: migration` with
`state: pending`, and migrates the legacy data in the background while live events are written as usual:

- One node at a time runs it, elected with the Redis lock `analytics-migration-lock` (TTL 60 s, refreshed after
  every batch); the other nodes retry every minute, so a node takes over when the runner dies.
- Phases: `events` (legacy events replayed through the same projections as live events, in timestamp order),
  `stats` (legacy stats through the stats pipeline), `reconcile` (the reconciler runs until nothing is left to
  close) and `cleanup` (`active_entities` and `last_alive` dropped). `legacy_events` and `stats` are never deleted:
  they expire by their own TTL, recorded as `legacyRetainedUntil`.
- Raw events keep the LiveKit `id` of the legacy event (`AE_LEG_<legacy _id>` when it had none). The close events
  the legacy fixer inserted are not replayed as events: their entity is closed by the reconciler at the fixer's
  time (`closedBy: reconciler`, `RECONCILED`); an authentic close event overrides it.
- Batches never split a second; after every batch the checkpoint (phase and last second per collection),
  `processed` and `counts` (`events`, `stats`, `synthetic`, `skipped`) are saved, so a restart resumes without
  reapplying a document. Transient MongoDB errors are retried 5 times; then the state is `failed` with the error,
  and the next start retries from the checkpoint. A replay forced again by deleting the `migration` document is a
  no-op for entities, events and rollups, but adds the legacy statistics again.
- While the migration has not completed, the reconciler leaves alone the candidates of nodes that never wrote a
  heartbeat in `nodes`: they are legacy entities the replay closes later.
- Progress is logged every 30 s (processed, total, documents per second, ETA) and on every phase.

Rollback: stop the new server, rename `legacy_events` back to `events`, drop the v2 collections and start the
previous version.

## Reconciler

Rooms, participant sessions, egress and ingress sessions stay open in the store when their end event never arrives
(a node crash, a shutdown that could not flush, a lost event). Every `reconciler.interval`, one node closes them; the
node is elected with the Redis lock `analytics-reconciler-lock` (TTL `reconciler.interval` + 5 s), or is the only node
without Redis.
A node also runs once right after startup.

- Candidates, found with indexed queries on the store only:
  - participant sessions without stats for 90 s (3 stats intervals), or, without any stats, active (joined when never
    active) for 90 s;
  - active rooms without stats for 90 s, without an open session of a kind that keeps a room open (every kind but
    `EGRESS` and `AGENT`), whose last event is older than their empty timeout plus 2 × `reconciler.interval`;
  - active rooms of a dead node without stats or events for 90 s, whatever their open sessions and empty timeout;
  - egress and ingress sessions not ended whose room closed more than 2 × `openvidu.cleanup_interval` ago on a dead
    node; LiveKit ends the others itself with real events.
- Confirmation: a node is dead when its heartbeat in `nodes` is older than 2 × `interval` and LiveKit's node registry
  does not list it as available. Participant sessions of a dead node are confirmed at once. Its rooms are confirmed
  once LiveKit's live state no longer lists their SID, since LiveKit recreates a room with the same SID on another
  node until the dead node cleanup removes it from Redis, or once their last signal is older than
  2 × `openvidu.cleanup_interval`; they close in the run that closes their last session, or in the first run after
  the cleanup. Candidates of an alive node are confirmed when they are absent from LiveKit's live state in two
  consecutive runs. A live state that cannot be read,
  or that lists no room while rooms of alive nodes receive stats (as right after a Redis restart), confirms nothing.
- Closure: the end time is the last signal of the entity, `max(lastStatsAt, lastEventAt)`; a stats flush during the
  last 30 s vetoes it. Closed documents carry `closedBy: reconciler` and the reason `RECONCILED` (egress: `failed` with
  `error: "egress lost (reconciled)"`; ingress sessions: `error`). Tracks and subscriptions of a closed participant,
  and open sessions of a closed room, close with the same end time. Counters and rollups are updated once, and one raw
  event of the close type with `synthetic: true` and `_id: AE_SYN_<entity id>` records each closure. A real close event
  arriving later corrects the end time and the reason without counting the closure again.
- Each run also sets the daily `uniqueIdentities` of the closed UTC days, logs one line per closure and records itself
  in `schema_meta` (`_id: reconciler`).

## Running locally

Launch the services of [`openvidu/docker-compose-setup`](./openvidu/docker-compose-setup) (Redis, MongoDB, egress, ingress, MinIO and the optional mongo-express):

```bash
docker compose -f openvidu/docker-compose-setup/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Run openvidu-livekit:

```bash
export LIVEKIT_CONFIG=$(cat ${PWD}/config.yaml)
go run ./cmd/server
```

Go to `http://localhost:8081` to explore the MongoDB database with mongo-express (`admin` username and `pass` password).

## Tests

- Unit tests: `go test ./openvidu/...`.
- Integration tests, which need Docker: `go test -tags integration ./openvidu/analytics/...`. They start a MongoDB replica set with Testcontainers on `openvidu/mongodb:8.0.29-r1` (`ANALYTICS_TEST_MONGO_IMAGE` overrides it), or use the server of `ANALYTICS_TEST_MONGO_URI`.
- Batch benchmark: the integration test `TestBatchPerformanceBudget` runs when `ANALYTICS_BENCH_MONGO_URI` and `ANALYTICS_BENCH_DB` name a database filled by the data generator of the OpenVidu Dashboard (`dashboard-ce/tools/data-generator`, scenario M, 7 days).
- The recorded events and stats used by the tests are described in [`openvidu/analytics/testdata`](./openvidu/analytics/testdata/README.md), and the legacy documents in [`openvidu/analytics/migration/testdata`](./openvidu/analytics/migration/testdata/README.md).
